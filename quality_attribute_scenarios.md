# Quality Attribute Scenarios

## Overview
This document outlines key quality attribute scenarios for the AI-driven certification system. Each scenario ensures that the system meets business priorities like performance, scalability, security, cost efficiency, and explainability.

## Quality Attribute Scenarios Table

| ID   | Quality Attribute | Scenario | Business Priority | Related To |
|------|------------------|----------|------------------|------------|
| QAS-1 | **Performance** | The AI system must process **batch grading of short-answer responses** within a **fixed batch window** to maintain a **one-week SLA**. | Hard | C-4 |
| QAS-2 | **Scalability** | The AI-based grading system must scale dynamically to handle **5-10X growth in certification requests** without degrading performance. | Hard | C-6 |
| QAS-3 | **Accuracy** | The AI grading system must maintain a **99% alignment** with expert architect grading to ensure credibility. | Hard | C-3, C-9 |
| QAS-5 | **Cost Efficiency** | AI grading infrastructure must **optimize compute costs** by ensuring batch processing operates **within a predefined budget** while maintaining SLA guarantees. | Soft | C-4 |
| QAS-6 | **Explainability** | AI-generated grades must provide **detailed reasoning** for the assigned score, ensuring that results are **interpretable by expert software architects**. | Hard | C-10 |
