# Detailed AI Use Cases

### AI in Aptitude Test Grading
1. Automated Short Answer Evaluation
- AI (LLMs like GPT-4, Claude Sonet) evaluates short-answer responses based on predefined metrics.
- AI assign an initial score and provide explanations.
- Edge cases (uncertain responses) are flagged for human review.

2. Plagiarism & Similarity Detection
- AI scans responses for copy-paste detection.
- Uses semantic similarity analysis to check against past responses.

3. Adaptive Feedback Generation
- AI auto-generates personalized feedback on incorrect answers.
- Example: "Your response lacked detail on event-driven architectures. Consider how microservices communicate asynchronously."

### AI in Architecture Submission Grading
1. AI-Assisted Architecture Review
- AI analyzes diagrams, documents, and descriptions against best practices.
- Uses computer vision (OCR) + NLP to interpret architecture diagrams (AWS Rekognition, Vision API).
- Suggests areas for improvement (e.g., missing scalability considerations).

2. AI-Generated Initial Score & Comments
- AI assigns a preliminary score with a confidence rating.
- High-confidence cases auto-graded, low-confidence cases flagged for expert review.
- Experts see AI-generated comments and approve/edit before finalizing.

### AI in Certification Candidate Authentication
1. Fraud Prevention & Identity Verification
- AI-powered facial recognition validates candidate identity during exam login.
- Prevents exam fraud via real-time webcam analysis.
