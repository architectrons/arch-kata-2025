## Date

## Context and problem statement
The SoftArchCert software system currently utilizes PostgreSQL as its primary database. As the system is being enhanced to include AI functionalities requiring vector similarity search, a decision needs to be made regarding the integration of vector database capabilities. The two primary options under consideration are **pgvector**, an extension for PostgreSQL, and **Pinecone**, a dedicated managed vector database.

## Decision drivers
The following factors influence this decision:

1. **Performance**: The ability to handle high-throughput, low-latency vector similarity searches.
2. **Cost**: Total cost of ownership, including infrastructure, licensing, and operational expenses.
3. **Integration**: Ease of integration with the existing PostgreSQL-based architecture.
4. **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing data volumes and query loads over time.
5. **Operational Complexity**: Effort required to maintain and optimize the solution.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: **pgvector**
- Use the `pgvector` extension to add vector search capabilities directly within the existing PostgreSQL database.

### Option 2: **Pinecone**
- Use Pinecone as a dedicated managed service for vector similarity search while keeping PostgreSQL for relational data.

## Decision Outcome
We have decided to adopt **pgvector** as the SoftArchCert vector database solution.

This decision aligns with our current architecture and team expertise while providing sufficient performance and cost advantages for our immediate needs. However, scalability limitations and operational challenges will be monitored closely, and a mitigation strategy will be in place should future requirements necessitate reevaluation.


## Pros and Cons

### Option 1: **pgvector**

#### Pros:
1. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Leverages the existing PostgreSQL setup, avoiding additional infrastructure or dependencies.
   - Simplifies data workflows by managing both relational and vector data in one system.

2. **Cost-Effective**:
   - Eliminates the need for an external managed service.
   - Benchmarks indicate it can be ~$70/month cheaper than Pinecone for comparable workloads.

3. **High Performance**:
   - Demonstrated superior performance in benchmarks:
     - Up to **28x lower p95 latency** and **16x higher query throughput** at 99% recall compared to Pinecone.

4. **Operational Maturity**:
   - Benefits from PostgreSQL’s robust features like ACID compliance, replication, backups, and point-in-time recovery.

#### Cons:
1. **Scalability Limitations**:
   - Horizontal scaling is more complex compared to Pinecone’s serverless architecture.
   - Performance may degrade as datasets grow beyond available memory or disk I/O bottlenecks occur.
   - However, the SoftArchCert Software System does not require this level of scalability at the moment.

2. **Operational Complexity**:
   - Requires additional tuning and optimization to ensure efficient vector operations.
   - Index building and large-scale queries may require significant resources.

3. **Limited Vector-Specific Features**:
   - Lacks advanced features like dynamic indexing or real-time updates optimized specifically for vectors (available in Pinecone).

### Option 2: **Pinecone**

#### Pros:
1. **Purpose-Built for Vectors**:
   - Optimized specifically for vector similarity search, offering advanced features like dynamic indexing and real-time updates.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Cloud-native architecture allows seamless horizontal scaling without manual intervention.
   - Ideal for handling massive datasets or unpredictable query loads.

3. **Low Operational Overhead**:
   - Fully managed service reduces maintenance effort (e.g., no need to manage hardware or tune indexes).

4. **Performance at Scale**:
   - Designed to maintain consistent performance even as data grows significantly.

#### Cons:
1. **Higher Cost**:
   - Managed services like Pinecone can be significantly more expensive than self-hosted solutions like pgvector.
   - Estimated ~$70/month more costly than pgvector for similar workloads.

2. **Integration Overhead**:
   - Requires managing an additional external service alongside PostgreSQL.
   - Potential data synchronization challenges between relational data in PostgreSQL and vectors in Pinecone.

3. **Vendor Lock-In Risk**:
   - Dependency on a third-party service could limit flexibility or increase costs over time.
  

## Mitigation Strategy

To address potential challenges with pgvector:

1. **Monitor Performance and Scalability**:
   - Regularly benchmark query performance as dataset size grows.
   - Monitor memory usage and disk I/O to ensure efficient index builds and query execution.

2. **Optimize Database Configuration**:
   - Tune PostgreSQL settings specifically for vector workloads (e.g., caching, indexing strategies).
   - Use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) techniques supported by pgvector to improve query speed without sacrificing accuracy.

3. **Plan for Scalability Needs**:
   - If dataset growth or query loads exceed pgvector’s capabilities, consider transitioning to a horizontally scalable solution like Pinecone or another dedicated vector database.
   - Design the system with modularity in mind to simplify future migration if necessary.

4. **Evaluate Long-Term Requirements Periodically**:
   - Reassess the decision annually or as new requirements emerge (e.g., real-time updates or dynamic indexing).
   - Stay informed about advancements in both pgvector and alternative solutions like Pinecone.

By documenting this decision, we aim to provide clarity on our technology choices and facilitate onboarding new team members while ensuring alignment within the architecture team.
