# Use AWS Cloud with Bedrock for Flexibility and Scalability

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-02-16  
**Deciders**: Architectrons

## Context and Problem Statement

The AI-driven certification system requires a robust cloud solution to handle model inference, data processing, and structured evaluation of candidate responses using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The primary concern is selecting a cloud provider that offers **scalability, security, cost-effectiveness, and AI-ready infrastructure** while minimizing operational overhead.

## Decision Drivers

* **Flexibility** – The system should support multiple AI models and dynamic workloads.  
* **Scalability** – The platform should handle varying certification test loads without infrastructure concerns.  
* **Security & Compliance** – The system must meet data privacy and certification requirements (e.g., GDPR, SOC2).  
* **Cost-effectiveness** – The solution should minimize upfront investment and optimize resource usage.  
* **Managed AI Services** – A cloud platform with pre-built AI services to accelerate development.  

## Considered Options

1. **AWS Cloud with Bedrock** – A fully managed cloud AI ecosystem.  
2. **Azure OpenAI Service** – Microsoft’s AI-powered cloud for structured AI workloads.  
3. **Google Cloud Vertex AI** – A flexible AI platform with generative AI capabilities.  
4. **On-Premise AI Infrastructure** – Running AI models on self-hosted servers.  

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: "AWS Cloud with Bedrock," because it provides a highly flexible and managed AI service ecosystem with native support for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multiple AI models, and seamless integration with other AWS cloud services.**

### Consequences

* **Good, because** AWS Bedrock offers **multiple foundational models (FM)**, allowing flexibility in AI selection.  
* **Good, because** AWS provides **managed security, IAM, and compliance features** to meet regulatory requirements.  
* **Good, because** AWS scales **automatically** with demand, eliminating infrastructure bottlenecks.  
* **Bad, because** reliance on AWS services leads to **vendor lock-in** for AI and cloud infrastructure.  
* **Bad, because** Bedrock's pricing model may be **higher** compared to self-managed AI inference on EC2.  

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### **AWS Cloud with Bedrock**  

* **Good, because** it supports **multiple AI models** under one service (Claude, Titan, Llama, etc.).  
* **Good, because** AWS has a **strong ecosystem** with S3, Lambda, and Step Functions for seamless workflow integration.  
* **Good, because** AWS handles **security, compliance, and automatic scaling** out of the box.  
* **Bad, because** potential **vendor lock-in** increases dependency on AWS ecosystem.  
* **Bad, because** **cost** could be higher than managing models on EC2 or alternative clouds.  

### **Azure OpenAI Service**  

* **Good, because** tight **integration with Microsoft tools** (Teams, Office, Dynamics).  
* **Good, because** supports **OpenAI models like GPT-4 directly**.  
* **Bad, because** fewer **AI model choices** compared to Bedrock.  
* **Bad, because** Azure may not provide **as flexible scaling options** as AWS.  

### **Google Cloud Vertex AI**  

* **Good, because** Google has **strong AI research and TPU-based model hosting**.  
* **Good, because** integrates with **BigQuery and data analytics tools**.  
* **Bad, because** fewer enterprise **RAG solutions** compared to AWS Bedrock.  
* **Bad, because** Google AI services may not be as **enterprise-adopted** as AWS/Azure.  

### **On-Premise AI Infrastructure**  

* **Good, because** full **control over infrastructure** without cloud vendor reliance.  
* **Good, because** may be **cheaper** for large-scale AI model inference.  
* **Bad, because** requires **high maintenance and operational complexity**.  
* **Bad, because** lacks **instant scalability** compared to cloud solutions.
